Hire Test
=========

A simple `flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/>`_ app that serves
a single "Hello World" page.

The service should be served by `gunicorn <https://gunicorn.org/>`_.

The assignment is to create a ``Dockerfile`` ready for a production
workload. Assume there is a reverse-proxy in front and the server is a single
Ubuntu server running the standard Docker daemon.
